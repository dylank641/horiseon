# Code Refactor Starter Code
This is the README for the Horiseon webpage

CHALLENGE FOR THE WEEK
-For the project I was assigned to give the website a better code structure for accessiblilty

STEPS FOR FIXING THE HEADER
-First I took a look at the at the header and nav code and saw that the semantic elements were non-existant
-I fixed it by switiching a lot of "divs" to "header" and "nav"

HERO IMAGE
-I switched the div it was in to "img" and gave it an alt attribute

FIXING THE CONTENT AND CSS
-There was a lot of html structuring that was wrong so i went through each section giving it the proper semantic elemnt and id/class
-I then got rid of the css code that was repeated and grouped them together reducing the amount of code written
-Throughout this process i was also was leaving comments to easily navigate through the code and making it easier for others to skim through
